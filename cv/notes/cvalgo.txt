Analysis:
-> All:
    run deep pose
    extract key points according to the work out
    
    -> Workout Specific:
        track key points using a tracking algorithm (i.e. Kernelized Correlation Filters)
        calculate relevant angles
        pass data into *Critique Function* -> critiques
        use critiques to form coherent advice
        **WIP** return relevant datapoints and advice
        
    
Critique Function:
-> Start:
    **TODO: come up with a scoring algorithm that will determine how 'wrong' someone is doing a workout**
    return critiques
    
    
Algorithm Notes:
-> Don't give the same advice over and over again
-> What happens if we lose tracking points

TODO:
-> Figure out how deep pose outputs data and map to body parts
